In the first episode, we have Kanish Gupta, he is our in-house problem-solver and captain. Talking to him personally clears a lot of my doubts. So, this episode is about What should be on your Resume? How important are your college marks? How to prepare for an interview?... These are some questions we usually ponder on and Kanishk answers them all!!
