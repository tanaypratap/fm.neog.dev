Stories are what bind people together and inspire them to achieve great heights in life. Stories are impressions in our memories that transcend from one decade to another. Our aim is to bring forth stories that talk about people who overcame challenges with grit and perseverance.

FM.Neog is an initiative that is currently being run by the members of the TeamTanay community, who are participating in the level 1 of NeogCamp. TeamTanay is an online community of 20,000+ developers across India and [NeogCamp](https://neog.camp/) is an initiative to get a beginner job ready in six months.

Whether you're a codenewbie or a seasoned tech pro, please feel free to reach out to us regarding your doubts or queries. We at FM.Neog will try our level best to get the right person to resolve your queries and guide you in the right direction.
